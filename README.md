# Brand

I am interested in fashion and marketing, I like to stay on top of trends and I take pride in having a good fashion sense. I would say my brand aesthetic would be simple but elevated, like maybe some fun pops of color but overall very simple and cohesive. I work at nordstrom and I enjoy the merchandising and styling aspects. I enjoy vintage goods, like home decor and clothing, I draw a lot of inspiration from vintage things that I enjoy. I also like pop culture and simple light hearted comedy.
